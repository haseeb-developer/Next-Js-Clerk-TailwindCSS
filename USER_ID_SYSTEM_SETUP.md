# User ID System Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ® Roblox-Style User ID System Implementation

This system creates unique sequential user IDs just like Roblox, where each user gets a unique number that never repeats.

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Steps

### 1. **Run Database Migration**
Execute the SQL file to create the user ID system:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor
-- File: create-user-id-system.sql
```

### 2. **Test the System**

#### **For New Users:**
1. Create a new account
2. The system will automatically assign them the next available ID number
3. Their public snippets will be available at: `URL/{their_id}/public-snippets`

#### **For Existing Users:**
1. When they first visit the app, they'll get assigned an ID number
2. Their existing public snippets will be available at their new ID URL

## ðŸ”— URL Structure

- **Global Public Snippets**: `URL/public-snippets` (shows all users' snippets)
- **User 1's Snippets**: `URL/1/public-snippets` (shows only User 1's snippets)
- **User 2's Snippets**: `URL/2/public-snippets` (shows only User 2's snippets)
- **User 3's Snippets**: `URL/3/public-snippets` (shows only User 3's snippets)
- **Invalid User**: `URL/999/public-snippets` (shows "User Not Found")

## âœ¨ Features

### **Sequential ID Assignment**
- User 1 gets ID: 1
