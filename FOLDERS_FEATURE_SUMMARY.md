## 📊 Technical Details

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- folders table
- id: UUID (Primary Key)
- user_id: TEXT (Clerk user ID)
- name: TEXT
- description: TEXT (optional)
- color: TEXT (hex color)
- icon: TEXT (icon identifier)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP

-- snippets table (updated)
- ... existing columns ...
- folder_id: UUID (nullable, references folders.id)
```

### Features:
- ✅ Folders are user-specific (filtered by `user_id`)
- ✅ Cascade behavior: Deleting a folder sets `folder_id` to NULL (doesn't delete snippets)
- ✅ Automatic `updated_at` trigger on folder updates
- ✅ Indexed for performance (`idx_snippets_folder_id`, `idx_folders_user_id`)

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

1. **Create folders** to organize your snippets by:
   - Programming language (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
   - Project (Personal, Work, Client X, etc.)
   - Type (Utils, Components, Hooks, etc.)
   - Any custom organization!

2. **Customize folders** with:
   - Unique colors for quick visual identification
   - Meaningful icons
   - Descriptions to remember what's inside

3. **Filter and organize**:
   - Click a folder to see only its snippets
   - Move snippets between folders
   - Keep some snippets at root level (no folder)

## 🔥 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If you want to add more features later, here are some ideas:

1. **Drag & Drop**: Drag snippets into folders
2. **Nested Folders**: Folders within folders
3. **Folder Sharing**: Share entire folders
4. **Bulk Operations**: Move multiple snippets at once
5. **Folder Templates**: Pre-made folder sets
6. **Smart Folders**: Auto-organize by language/tags
7. **Folder Stats**: Charts showing snippet distribution
8. **Export/Import**: Include folder structure
